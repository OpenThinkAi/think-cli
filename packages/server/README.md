# open-think-server

HTTP backend for the open-think CLI. Stores **events** fanned out from external sources (GitHub, Linear, Slack, ...) plus the **subscriptions** that describe what each local think install is watching. The CLI polls `/v1/events` to feed those events into its local engram pipeline; in-process connectors (driven by a per-subscription scheduler) populate the `events` table.

This is the proxy-role rewrite the [think-cli v2 pivot](https://openthink.dev) called for. v0.2.0 retired the cortex storage role; v0.3.0 landed the events + subscriptions surface; **v0.4.0 lands the poll-worker framework**. The CLI-side connector glue and the per-source connectors beyond `mock` land in follow-up tickets (AGT-029+).

## Endpoints

All success responses wrap the resource in an envelope (`{ subscription }`, `{ subscriptions }`, `{ events, next_since }`) so future metadata can land without breaking consumers. All error responses are `{ error: string, detail?: ... }`.

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose | Success | Errors |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/v1/health` | — | Liveness probe. **Process-reachable only**, no DB probe. | `200 { status, version }` | — |
| `GET` | `/v1/events` | Bearer | Read events for a subscription. Required `?subscription_id=<id>`; optional `?since=<server_seq>` (default `0`) and `?limit=<n>` (default `100`, max `1000`). Updates `subscriptions.last_polled_at` as a side effect. | `200 { events: [{ id, subscription_id, payload, server_seq, created_at }], next_since }`. **`next_since` is `null` when the page is empty** — retain your prior cursor and re-poll. | `400` invalid query (missing/invalid `subscription_id`, `since`, or `limit` over 1000); `404` unknown `subscription_id` (deliberate — saves you from polling a typo'd id forever) |
| `POST` | `/v1/subscriptions` | Bearer | Create a subscription. Body `{ kind, pattern }` — both trimmed, must be non-empty after trimming; **`kind` is not validated against an allowlist** (connectors define their own kinds, e.g. `github`, `linear`, `slack`). **No dedup** — POSTing the same `(kind, pattern)` twice yields two distinct subscriptions, each with its own cursor. Intentional for the fan-out model where each consumer owns its own poll position. Sets a `Location: /v1/subscriptions/{id}` header on the 201. | `201 { subscription: { id, kind, pattern, created_at, last_polled_at } }` | `400` with `error: "invalid json body"` (malformed/missing JSON) or `error: "invalid body"` (schema validation failed; `detail` carries Zod issues) |
| `GET` | `/v1/subscriptions` | Bearer | List all subscriptions, ordered by `created_at`. | `200 { subscriptions: [{ id, kind, pattern, created_at, last_polled_at }] }` | — |
| `GET` | `/v1/subscriptions/:id` | Bearer | Fetch one. | `200 { subscription: {...} }` | `404` unknown id |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/subscriptions/:id` | Bearer | Remove. Cascades to events for that subscription. | `204` | `404` unknown id |

Two non-route status codes are reachable:

- **`410 Gone`** for any `/v1/cortexes/*` path — the retired 0.1.x cortex storage routes. Returned **without auth** so operators upgrading from 0.1.x can see the migration pointer without configuring a token first. Body: `{ error: "cortex storage retired", detail: "..." }`.
- **`404 Not Found`** for any other unknown path on an authed call. Body lists the served endpoints. Unauthed callers hit the bearer middleware first and get `401` — set `THINK_TOKEN` if you're diagnosing.

## Auth

`/v1/health` is unauthenticated so load-balancer probes work without credentials. Everything else requires `Authorization: Bearer <THINK_TOKEN>`. The server **fails to boot** if `THINK_TOKEN` is not set.

Comparison is constant-time (`crypto.timingSafeEqual`) — pick a long random token (32+ bytes recommended).

## Storage

Single SQLite file. Path configurable via `THINK_DB_PATH` (default: `./open-think.sqlite` relative to the working directory). The file is created on first boot. Schema:

- `subscriptions(id TEXT PK, kind, pattern, created_at, last_polled_at, cursor)` — `cursor` is opaque per-connector JSON (TEXT) the framework persists verbatim; each connector picks its own shape.
- `events(id, subscription_id, payload_json, server_seq INTEGER PK AUTOINCREMENT, created_at)` with `FOREIGN KEY (subscription_id) → subscriptions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE` and `UNIQUE(subscription_id, id)` so `INSERT OR IGNORE` safely tolerates a connector replaying ids on transient errors.

Cursor pagination uses `server_seq` as the monotonic cursor. Single-process / single-writer is by design (matches the v2 single-tenant decision); a multi-writer setup would need a separate sequence source.

Event `payload` is **connector-defined** — the server stores `payload_json` opaquely and parses it back to JSON on read. No schema is enforced server-side; that responsibility lands with the connectors.

`subscriptions.last_polled_at` has two writers: the `GET /v1/events` read endpoint (so the connector knows someone is consuming) and the scheduler on every successful poll (so operators can see the source side is healthy too). Whichever is more recent wins — both are truthful "most recent activity" signals.

`subscriptions.cursor` was added in 0.4.0; existing 0.3.x DBs are migrated via an idempotent `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` on first boot.

## Running

```sh
THINK_TOKEN=<long-random-token> \
PORT=3000 \
THINK_DB_PATH=./open-think.sqlite \
THINK_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS=600 \
  npx open-think-server
```

`THINK_TOKEN` is required; `PORT` defaults to `3000`; `THINK_DB_PATH` defaults to `./open-think.sqlite` relative to the working directory; `THINK_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` defaults to `600` (10 minutes). All env vars share the `THINK_` prefix.

Or via `docker-compose` at the repo root (set `THINK_TOKEN` in the environment first):

```sh
THINK_TOKEN=<...> docker compose up server
```

## If you ran a previous version

`open-think-server@0.1.x` exposed `/v1/cortexes/...` against a Postgres backing store. Those endpoints retired in 0.2.0 (AGT-026); they return 404 in 0.3.0. The migration path for any 0.1.x data is documented in the 0.2.0 README — keep 0.1.x running, run `think cortex migrate --to fs --path <folder>` on each peer, then retire the 0.1.x server. There is no first-class import from a `pg_dump` — file a `gh issue` against `OpenThinkAi/think-cli` if you need one.

The `pgdata` Docker volume from the 0.1.x `docker-compose.yml` is orphaned; clean it up with:

```sh
docker volume ls | grep pgdata
docker volume rm <project>_pgdata
```

## Polling

The server runs a per-subscription scheduler in-process. Every `THINK_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default `600`) it iterates active subscriptions, looks up the registered connector for each `kind`, calls `connector.poll({ subscription, credential, cursor })`, and persists the returned events plus the new cursor in a single transaction. `last_polled_at` is bumped on success only — failures leave it untouched so it stays a truthful "last successful contact" signal.

Polls within a tick run **serially**: `node:sqlite` is `DatabaseSync` so JS-level parallelism doesn't help the writes, and per-source rate limits are per-credential so it doesn't help the source either. A wedged connector is bounded by a 60s per-poll timeout; failures are logged, recorded in the tick report, and don't propagate — the next tick retries the failed sub. A tick will not start while the previous tick is still running (overlap guard via `setTimeout`-recurse).

Registered connector kinds in 0.4.0:

- **`mock`** — synthetic event generator used by the e2e test. Pattern `"N"` (integer string) emits N events per poll with monotonic ids; anything else emits one. Cursor is `{ count: number }`.

The repo also ships `src/connectors/github.draft.ts` — a header-only **design sketch** that pressure-tests the `SourceConnector` interface against GitHub's per-endpoint ETag / `If-None-Match` / rate-limit semantics. It is **not registered**, **not invoked**, and does not call out to GitHub. The real GitHub connector lands in AGT-029+ alongside credential storage.

Read endpoints (`GET /v1/events`, `GET /v1/subscriptions/...`) are unchanged and unaware of the scheduler — connectors and consumers stay decoupled through the events table.

## Testing

```sh
npm test -w open-think-server
```

No external dependencies — the suite stands up the Hono app in-process against a `:memory:` SQLite DB.
